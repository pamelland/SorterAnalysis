What we need for a minimal example:

1) "Inflate" snippets into a full voltage trace  (needed because full trace will be too large for Github)

2) Extract/save waveforms from voltage trace
   In extract_waveforms, list options that need to be set for minimal example

3) Direct users to a file like "set_main_path".
    - Include (additionally) directories for the snippets, waveforms, etc..

Data needed:
- Voltage snippets ('Spikes001.mat')
   - (compressed version of full voltage trace?)
- Spike times and unit IDs from sorter on each block.


Alternative possibility: make a smaller "minimal example" with a full voltage trace

i.e. 
EXAMPLE #1: 3 2 hr- blocks: 0-2, 1-3, 2-4

EXAMPLE #2: 3 10 min blocks: 0-10, 5-15, 10-20
Provide full voltage trace (20 min)
